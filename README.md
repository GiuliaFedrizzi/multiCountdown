# multiCountdown
A timer to alternate work and breaks automatically, without having to start timers when a work session/break is over. Set how long the work session must be (sessionTime), how long breaks should last (breakTime) and a total number of sessions (sum of work sessions and breaks). You'll have an alarm every sessionTime and an alarm after the break is over. It's set to 25 minutes work - 5 minutes break at the moment, following the Pomodoro technique.
It works on my mac.
